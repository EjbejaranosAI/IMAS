# ‚ú® IMAS MULTI-AGENT SYSTEMS ‚ú®

MAS (Integrated Multi-Agent Systems) is a software platform for developing multi-agent systems. It is based on the JADE (Java Agent DEvelopment Framework) platform and provides a set of tools and libraries for building agent-based systems.

In a multi-agent system, multiple agents interact with each other and with their environment to achieve a common goal or solve a problem. Each agent is a self-contained software entity that can act independently and communicate with other agents. The agents in a multi-agent system are typically distributed and communicate with each other using a message-passing model.

cd dedale-etu
```

```
mvn install java exec:
```


### üíª Some Demo examples
#### Rio: the big map
This demo shows the general picture of how all agents combined behave in a real world scenario map. In this case this is a residential are from Rio de Janeiro. This can be further explored executing the main branch.

After some iterations, the agents are able to collect all the treasures present in the map. It would look like the following:

#### Backoff mechanism of collectors
This demo demonstrates how collectors can backoff when they collide between them during a mission. Since they cannot improvise (no map knowledge), one of them needs to backtrack his path until he finds a node of escape and allow that way to the other collector to move on in his mission.

This can be reproduced executing the "conflict_demo".

#### Mission workflow on simplified map
This demo shows how useful it can be, in a final stage where only one treasure is left to finish the problem, to have a mission mechanism. The diamond collector finds the diamond treasure (which he cannot collect in one go) and the explorers tell him the shortest path to it every time they cross paths.

This can be reproduced executing the "conflict_demo".

#### Fast resolution on grid map
This is an example on how the problem is solved in a simplified map.

This can be reproduced executing the "conflict_demo".
