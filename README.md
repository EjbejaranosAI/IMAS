# ‚ú® IMAS MULTI-AGENT SYSTEMS ‚ú®

MAS (Integrated Multi-Agent Systems) is a software platform for developing multi-agent systems. It is based on the JADE (Java Agent DEvelopment Framework) platform and provides a set of tools and libraries for building agent-based systems.

In a multi-agent system, multiple agents interact with each other and with their environment to achieve a common goal or solve a problem. Each agent is a self-contained software entity that can act independently and communicate with other agents. The agents in a multi-agent system are typically distributed and communicate with each other using a message-passing model.
